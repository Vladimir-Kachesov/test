  abstract     = {Electrophysiological  data  from  implanted  electrodes  in  the  human  brain  are  rare,  and therefore scientific access to it has remained somewhat exclusive. Here we present a freely-available curated library of implanted electrocorticographic (ECoG) data and analyses for 16 benchmark  experiments,  with  approximately 250  individual  datasets  made  with  the same amplifiers (at the same sampling rate and filter settings)over an eight-year period. For each subject, behavioral experiments known tobe associated with covered brain areas were performed.
In every case, electrode positions have been carefully registered to brain anatomy.
A  large  set  of  fully-commented  analysis  scripts  to  interpret  these  data  using modern  techniques  is  embedded  in the library  alongside  the  data.
All  data,  anatomiccorrelations, and analysis files (MATLAB code) are in a common, intuitive file structureat https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/zk881ps0522
