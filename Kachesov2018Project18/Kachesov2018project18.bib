  abstract = {Electrophysiological  data  from  implanted  electrodes  in  the  human  brain  are  rare,  and 
therefore scientific access to it has remained somewhat exclusive. Here we present a freely
-
available curated library of implanted electrocorticograp
hic (ECoG) data and analyses for 
16  benchmark  experiments,  with  approximately  250  individual  datasets  made  with  the 
same amplifiers (at the same sampling rate and filter settings)
over an eight
-
year period
. 
For each subject, b
ehavioral experiments known to
be associated with covered brain areas 
were performed
.
In every case, electrode positions have been carefully registered to brain 
anatomy
.
A  large  set  of  fully
-
commented  analysis  scripts  to  interpret  these  data  using 
modern  techniques  is  embedded  in 
the 
library  alongside  the  data.
All  data,  anatomic
correlations
, and analysis files (MATLAB code) are in a common, intuitive file structure
at 
https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/zk881ps0522
